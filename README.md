# Honkai-Impact-3-Exalted-Abyss-Analysis
Sequel to Abyss analysis. Honkai Impact 3 Abyss is a PvP mode where players compete against one another to see who can obtain the highest score. Players within each rank will gain or lose trophies depending on their score in the end of the round. The number of trophies determines which Abyss rank you fall in. In this analysis, I attempt to uncover what is required of me to obtain good outcomes, which is to not lose trophies in Red Lotus Rank, the second highest rank in the game.
