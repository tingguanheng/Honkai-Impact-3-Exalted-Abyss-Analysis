# Honkai-Impact-3-Exalted-Abyss-Analysis
Sequel to Abyss analysis. Honkai Impact 3 Abyss is a PvP mode where players compete against one another to see who can obtain the highest score. Players within each rank will gain or lose trophies depending on their score. The number of trophies in the end determines which Abyss rank you fall in. In this analysis, I attempt to uncover what is required of me to obtain good outcomes, which is retaining in Red Lotus Rank.
